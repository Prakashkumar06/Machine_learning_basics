# Basics of Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the foundational concepts of Machine Learning (ML). It serves as a resource for anyone starting their journey into ML or looking to refresh their knowledge on core topics.

## Topics Covered
- **Supervised Learning**: Explore algorithms that learn from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Delve into clustering and association algorithms that work with unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Understand the principles of agents learning from interactions with their environment.

### Statistical Concepts
- **Variance and Bias**: Learn about the trade-offs between model complexity and generalization.
- **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Identify when a model is too complex or too simple for the given data.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Discover strategies to deal with incomplete datasets.
- **Handling Imbalanced Datasets**: Tackle challenges posed by disproportionate class distributions.
- **SMOTE**: Implement Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for enhancing dataset balance.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Outliers**: Detect and manage anomalies in data.
- **Feature Selection**: Choose the most relevant features for model training.
- **Feature Extraction**: Transform data into a more manageable form.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardize or normalize features to improve model performance.
- **Normalization (Min-Max)**: Scale features to a range between 0 and 1.
- **Unit Vector Transformation**: Convert features into unit vectors.

### Dimensionality Reduction and Encoding
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving variance.
- **Data Encoding**: Convert categorical data into numerical format.
- **Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**: Rank categories based on target variable statistics.

### Correlation Analysis
- **Covariance and Correlation**: Measure and interpret the relationships between variables.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then set up a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
